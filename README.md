**My Cute Vector Database**
A database so smart, it'll store your vectors and still have room for your existential crises.


**What’s This About?**
Ever wanted to save your vectors locally like a proud parent saving their kid’s art? Or retrieve them at lightning speed with a sprinkle of Rust magic? Well, you’re in the right repo. This project combines:

1) SQLite (because every vector needs a database)
2) Rust (because Python can sometimes be slow. Sorry, Python.)
3) Python (You know the drill..).

It’s your local vector database with some serious skills.
Store vectors.
Retrieve vectors.
Calculate Similarities.

Coming soon...
